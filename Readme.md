# K65 compiler templates

My own small project templates using K65 compilers for different platforms. Every template is set in seperate directory. Every template needs to have set K65_PATH environmental variable pointing to K65 SDK root directory and emulator binaries needs to be place inside K65_PATH\bin directory.
